# REKTsume


Ever felt jealous seeing your friend's colourful resume, filled to the brim with self-driven projects and work experiences? Tired of your friends using their resume to land internship opportunities while you struggle to write more than half a page of your resume?

REKTsume is the solution for you. See, you do not need to spend time improving your own resume through embarking on exhausting projects and online courses that are waaaayyy too long when you can just sabotage your friends' resumes instead! Why work hard when you can cheat to gain an unfair advantage over your friends?


REKTsume is a website where your friend can fill up their long list of technical skills, work experiences and education achievements to generate a resume. However, REKTsume will make sure their resume is as unflattering as possible.
